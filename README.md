### 🛠️ Development Notes

- **Frontend:** 
  - Uses Vite for fast development builds.
  - React Router for handling routing in a single-page application (SPA).
  - Components are styled using CSS/SCSS Modules.
  
- **Backend:** 
  - NestJS is used to build the REST API.
  - PostgreSQL stores all persistent data (users, orders, transactions).
  - JWT authentication ensures secure access control.
